            <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
                <p>This dish is a deli egg-bacon-and-cheese-on-a-roll that has been pasta-fied, fancified, fetishized and turned into an
                     Italian tradition that, like many inviolate Italian traditions, is actually far less old than the Mayflower.</p>
                <p>Because America may have contributed to its creation, carbonara is Exhibit A in the back-and-forth between
                     Italy and the United States when it comes to food. Remember: the main goal is creaminess.</p>
        <h3><em>What ingredients will you need?</em></h3>

                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>2 large eggs and 2 large yolks, room temperature</li>
                <li>1 ounce (about 1/3 packed cup) grated pecorino Romano, plus additional for serving</li>
                <li>1 ounce (about 1/3 packed cup) grated Parmesan</li>
                <li>Coarsely ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>3 1/2 ounces pancetta or bacon, sliced into 1/4 inch thick by 1/3 inch square</li>
                <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>

        <h3><em>How to cook</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 tablespoon salt) over high heat, and 
                bring to a boil. Fill a large bowl with hot water for serving, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and pecorino and Parmesan. Season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper.</li>
            <li>Set the water to boil. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, add the pork, and saut√© until the fat just renders, on the
                 edge of crispness but not hard. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. Just before pasta is ready, reheat guanciale in skillet, if needed.
                 Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and add to the skillet over low heat. Stir for a minute or so.</li>
            <li>Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture. Stir in cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water if needed for creaminess. </li>
            <li>Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of additional grated pecorino and pepper.</li>
        </ol>
